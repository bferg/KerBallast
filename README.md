# KerBallast

KerBallast is a simple mod for "Kerbal Space Program" that uses the awesome power of [ModuleManager](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219) to add a ballast resource type to selected parts. The ballast is a tweakable, free resource that adds weight and nothing else to the parts.

## Usage

Tweak your ballast settings on each part in the craft editor in the space plane hangar, and watch the center of mass shift. The following parts have been updated, but without tweaking will behave the same as stock parts.

* all intakes
* nose cone
* MK1-2 pod
* MK2 cockpit
* MK3 cockpit
* NCS nose cone adapter

The ballast is fixed and not movable in flight (although a possible future upgrade is to add custom parts with transferable ballast). Each unit of ballast corresponds to 100 kg of weight.

## Installation

Move the `KerBallast` directory in the zip file to the `GameData` directory in your Kerbal Space Program application directory.
